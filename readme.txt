This is my first trial in Git
Sanjay is learning Git
Git is a Source Code Managment

This is how I learnt 
discarding lines or removing lines-
1.before adding to staging area
2. after adding to staging area

Can we delete/discard/remove line after commiting the changes? - Need to check this

Thus changes are done
through remote repo

go and check local repo
